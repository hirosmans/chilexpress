# Chilexpress

Get Chilexpress shipment information.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'chilexpress'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install chilexpress

## Usage

```ruby
# you must provide a valid Chilexpress tracking code
tracking_code = '123456'

# this will take a while, Chilexpress's site response time is quite slow
result = Chilexpress.get_order(tracking_code)

# you can get the following shipment information
puts result.order_number
puts result.product_type
puts result.service_type
puts result.status

# if the shipment has been delivered, you can get the receiver's details
receiver = result.receiver

if receiver
  puts receiver.name
  puts receiver.rut
  puts receiver.delivery_date
  puts receiver.delivery_time  
end

# you can also get the detailed tracking information
result.tracking_entries.each do |entry|
  puts entry.date
  puts entry.time
  puts entry.activity
end
```
